      <h2>Core Concepts & Mechanics — The Fundamentals</h2>
      <p class="small">This page documents the mechanical building blocks that inform every decision in Clash Royale: resource flow, card roles, targetting, timing, and match rhythm. Read this thoroughly to understand why high-level plays work and how to reproduce them.</p>

      <h3 id="elixir">1. Elixir: your central resource</h3>
      <p>Elixir is the single resource that governs what you can do on the battlefield. It regenerates continuously up to a maximum of 10. Understanding elixir is the foundation for making correct plays.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regeneration rate:</strong> roughly 1 elixir per 2.8 seconds in normal time (double elixir phases change this). Use timers in your head — many high-level players track elixir by approximating the time since the opponent last played.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive and negative trades:</strong> A positive trade is spending less elixir to remove more elixir worth of opponent troops (e.g., using a 2-elixir card to stop a 5-elixir push). Aim for positive trades to build a sustainable advantage.</li>
        <li><strong>Elixir advantage vs tempo:</strong> Elixir advantage (net elixir saved) can become a tempo advantage if you convert it into pressure at the right time. Conversely, tempo (forcing the opponent to react) can grant you advantages even when elixir is roughly equal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="overcommitting">2. Overcommitting</h3>
      <p>Overcommitting is one of the most common mistakes. It happens when you spend so much elixir that you cannot answer the opponent's next play.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Common overcommit scenarios: placing a beatdown tank at the bridge when the opponent holds cheap bridge spam or swarm counters; playing both heavy support troops on offense without defensive elixir left.</li>
        <li>How to avoid it: always account for the opponent's likely counters (e.g., spell, small swarm). If you're unsure, prefer defensive placement and wait for clarity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="tempo-cycle">3. Tempo and cycle</h3>
      <p>Tempo is who forces actions. Cycle decks use low-cost cards to reach their key card more frequently; heavy decks try to build one decisive push.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycle play:</strong> Reaching a win condition (like Hog Rider) more often than the opponent can respond. Cycle decks rely on fast cards, disciplined chip, and punishing slow rotations.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempo play:</strong> Use small, repeated threats to keep the opponent on the defensive so they cannot assemble a large push.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="archetypes">4. Deck archetypes and win conditions</h3>
      <p>Every deck has a win condition — the primary method of dealing tower damage. Understanding archetypes helps you formulate game plans and tech choices.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beatdown:</strong> Build a big push around a tank (Golem, Giant). Play slow and accumulate elixir behind your tank. Protect supports.</li>
        <li><strong>Siege:</strong> Use long-range buildings/units (Mortar, X-Bow) to chip towers. Protect the siege tool and play defensively when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> Defend for value, take advantage of positive trades, and win with efficient counters and small pushes.</li>
        <li><strong>Chip:</strong> Use repeated small damage sources and spells to whittle the tower down over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge spam / cycle:</strong> Quick pressure with bridge units, often requiring precise timing and prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Mix elements to adapt to opponents — e.g., beatdown with chip components.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="cards-and-targeting">5. Card types, targeting, and range</h3>
      <p>Knowing what each card can target and its range determines how it will interact on the board.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Troop targeting:</strong> Ground-only, air & ground, building-targeting, or spells. Example: Minions target air & ground, while Cannon targets ground only (and is a building).</li>
        <li><strong>Range and attack priority:</strong> A unit with longer range can often snipe supports; splash damage trades favor positions where the splash can hit multiple units.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment placement:</strong> Placing units at the right tile can kite, split, or bait. Understanding tile distances is a skill that improves with practice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="buildings-spells">6. Buildings and spells</h3>
      <p>Buildings and spells are tools that alter positioning and value exchange.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buildings:</strong> Defensive buildings (Cannon, Tesla) kite and stall, while siege buildings (Mortar, X-Bow) act as win conditions. Use buildings to change the lane priority and to reset enemy targeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Spells:</strong> Spells are guaranteed area/targeted effects. They create value when used to remove or chip while simultaneously damaging towers (e.g., Fireball that hits a unit and the tower).</li>
        <li><strong>Spell economy:</strong> Saving your spell for maximum value is a key skill — sometimes the best play is to save a spell and concede a small unit rather than overcommit to maximize value later.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="roles">7. Troop roles and synergies</h3>
      <p>Every unit fills roles that can be combined to produce complementary pushes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tank:</strong> Soaks damage (Golem, Giant).</li>
        <li><strong>Glass cannon / high DPS:</strong> High damage, low HP (Mini P.E.K.K.A, Musketeer).</li>
        <li><strong>Support / splash:</strong> Deals area damage or supports the tank (Wizard, Baby Dragon).</li>
        <li><strong>Swarm:</strong> Cheap units in bulk that overwhelm single-target troops (Skeletons, Goblin Gang).</li>
        <li><strong>Utility:</strong> Stallers, stun, or special interaction cards (Tornado, Inferno Tower).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="positioning">8. Positioning and placement theory</h3>
      <p>Placement matters as much as card choice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kiting:</strong> Place buildings or units to lure attacking troops away from towers and into favorable counters.</li>
        <li><strong>Splitting troops:</strong> Use splits to make spells less efficient (spread out units so single AoE spells do less value).</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive placement:</strong> Place answers where you expect the opponent to play — a successful prediction can win a match.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="timing">9. Timing, phases, and match windows</h3>
      <p>Matches have ephemeral windows where certain plays are stronger.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opening moves:</strong> Early plays reveal the opponent's deck or help you cycle; many pros prefer passive openings unless they have strong bridge pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Single-elixir vs double-elixir:</strong> Many decks shift strategy between single and double elixir. Beatdown decks aim to assemble larger pushes in double elixir, while cycle decks intensify bridge pressure in single elixir.</li>
        <li><strong>Sudden death / overtime:</strong> Risk tolerance changes; be conservative with overcommitment unless a clear winning line appears.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="meta">10. Meta, balance, and adaptability</h3>
      <p>The meta is an emergent property of card availability and balance patches. Be ready to adapt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watch patch notes for buffs/nerfs and the addition/removal of key cards from the meta.</li>
        <li>Experiment in friendly battles or challenges before bringing a deck to ladder.</li>
        <li>Use substitution logic: if a key card is nerfed, find cards that fulfill the same mechanical role (e.g., replace a king of swarm control with other area damage).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="practice">11. Practice and learning</h3>
      <p>Deliberate practice beats mindless grinding. Use replays to identify mistakes (overcommits, missed counters, mispositioning) and focus on one or two weak points per session.</p>
