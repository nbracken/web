      <h2>Monetization, Cosmetics, and Pay-to-Win</h2>
      <p class="small">Clash Royale uses a freemium model. This page explains what purchases buy you, where spending affects gameplay, and how to make informed decisions as a player or clan leader.</p>

      <h3 id="what-does-money-buy">1. What purchases provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Faster card acquisition:</strong> Gems and special offers can accelerate chests and card unlocks, allowing faster upgrades.</li>
        <li><strong>Gold and card bundles:</strong> Gold buys upgrades; bundles accelerate the process. This reduces grind time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmetics:</strong> Emotes, tower skins, and card skins do not affect gameplay but are part of player expression.</li>
        <li><strong>Entries and season passes:</strong> Paying for challenges, event entries, or season passes can provide resources and gating-exclusive cosmetics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="is-p2w">2. Is Clash Royale pay-to-win?</h3>
      <p>Pay-to-win (P2W) implies money gives a decisive advantage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ladder:</strong> Spending reduces grind and lets players upgrade cards faster. Since ladder matchups are sensitive to level, money can be influential here.</li>
        <li><strong>Tournaments & Challenges:</strong> These often normalize levels, reducing direct P2W effects and emphasizing skill.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill vs spending:</strong> While money can accelerate access to higher levels, skillful play, knowledge, and discipline often overcome purely level-based advantages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="responsible-spending">3. Responsible spending & recommended purchases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize long-term value:</strong> Season passes and challenge bundles you will use often tend to be better value than one-off cosmetics.</li>
        <li><strong>Set a budget:</strong> Decide monthly spending limits and stick to them. Consider the non-monetary costs (time spent playing) alongside purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Community and donations:</strong> If you buy a lot, contribute to donations and help your clanmates so that the whole community benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="ethics-and-community">4. Ethics, fairness, and community impacts</h3>
      <p>Excessive monetization can create imbalance in communities. Leaders should be mindful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourage fair donation practices and avoid ostracizing free-to-play players.</li>
        <li>Use internal tournaments that normalize card levels to ensure skill development matters.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="alternatives">5. Alternatives to spending</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time investment:</strong> Regular play, smart crown farming, and efficient requests can offset lack of spending.</li>
        <li><strong>Community trades:</strong> Coordinate clan donations and request strategies to accelerate specific upgrades.</li>
      </ul>
