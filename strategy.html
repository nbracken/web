      <h2>Strategy — How to Win Consistently</h2>
      <p class="small">This section consolidates practical, repeatable strategies for ladder, challenges, and casual play. It focuses on decision-making, deck construction, match planning, and mid-match adjustments.</p>

      <h3 id="trophy-pushing">1. Trophy pushing: plan, practice, repeat</h3>
      <p>Trophy pushing is about consistency and match selection as much as raw skill.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Master a small set of decks:</strong> Pick 1–3 decks for pushing. Knowing all matchups intimately beats switching constantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand your card-level ceiling:</strong> If your cards are underleveled for a bracket, expect to rely more on skillful positioning and less on head-on trades.</li>
        <li><strong>Time your climbs:</strong> Play during stable meta windows and avoid long losing streaks — mental fatigue reduces win rate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="crown-farming">2. Crown farming and resource efficiency</h3>
      <p>Crown farming focuses on quickly getting crowns for chests or season rewards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-win-rate, quick-decision decks:</strong> Fast cycle decks, cheap bridge spam, or safe control decks that force mistakes make crown farming efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>2v2 for crowns:</strong> Many players use 2v2 to collect crowns faster because fewer mistakes are punished; coordinate with a friend for maximum efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop-loss discipline:</strong> If a match goes long and the opponent is clearly better, accept the loss — wasting time on unwinnable games reduces crown/hour.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="deck-building">3. Deck construction principles</h3>
      <p>Good deck construction balances elixir curve, roles, and answers.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Win condition:</strong> Identify the main damage dealer (Hog, X-Bow, Golem) and build to protect and support it.</li>
        <li><strong>Defense suite:</strong> Include at least one flexible defensive tool (Tornado, Zap, Fireball) and a reliable hard-answer for win conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Elixir curve:</strong> Balance low-cost cards for cycle with a couple of medium-cost support units. Avoid too many high-cost cards that make you vulnerable to fast pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Include cards that serve multiple roles (e.g., Electro Wizard for stun + support).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="match-planning">4. Match planning and reads</h3>
      <p>Form a short-term game plan at the start based on your opening and your opponent's opening plays.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Opening intelligence:</strong> The opponent's first play reveals a lot — a slow tank suggests a beatdown plan; repeated bridge swarms suggest cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive mid-game:</strong> Shift lanes, change spell timing, and choose when to commit resources to offense vs defense.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-lane pressure:</strong> If the opponent overcommits on one lane, punish the opposite lane quickly to force split focus.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="managing-elixir">5. Managing elixir and trades</h3>
      <p>Count elixir mentally and learn to estimate opponent resources. Key techniques:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Track last card seen:</strong> If you know the opponent spent 7 elixir, you can safely apply a 5-elixir threat.</li>
        <li><strong>Force bad plays:</strong> Apply threats that make the opponent respond suboptimally (e.g., chip plus a small troop that demands a spell).</li>
        <li><strong>Save key counters:</strong> Retain spells or buildings if a major push is possible soon (e.g., during double elixir).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="mind-games">6. Mind games, prediction, and bait</h3>
      <p>High-level play mixes direct answers with prediction and baiting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bait concept:</strong> Force the opponent to waste their spell on low-value targets, then punish the now-vulnerable tower or troop.</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction plays:</strong> Use history (what the opponent has played before) to predict and pre-place counters; these are high-risk, high-reward plays.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempo bluffing:</strong> Fake a push to cause a defensive reaction, then punish the elixir hole.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="playing-ladder-vs-tournaments">7. Ladder vs tournament play</h3>
      <p>Understand the difference in environment and adapt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ladder:</strong> Card level differences and inconsistent opponents. Favor robust, easy-to-execute decks that survive level variance.</li>
        <li><strong>Tournament / Challenge:</strong> Standardized levels; skill-focused. Use nuanced plays, prediction, and optimized tech cards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="practice-routine">8. Practice routine and improvement loop</h3>
      <p>Structured practice accelerates improvement much more than raw playtime:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Record and review replays: identify 2–3 mistakes per loss and find a concrete correction.</li>
        <li>Practice key micro-skills: spell value (timing/placement), kiting distances, and predictive placements.</li>
        <li>Mirror matches and drills: practice specific matchups repeatedly (e.g., Hog vs building deck) to build muscle memory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="examples">9. Example lines (short, practical plays)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When you have a +4 elixir advantage:</strong> Apply bridge pressure with a medium-cost win condition while holding a cheap defensive responder (e.g., Goblin Gang). Convert advantage to tower damage.</li>
        <li><strong>When opponent plays a lone heavy tank at the back:</strong> Save a small spell and a medium DPS troop; bait out their support then punish the tank's lane.</li>
        <li><strong>Against bait decks:</strong> Hold swipe spells for high-value targets and use split lanes to make their spells inefficient.</li>
      </ul>
