      <h2>Evolutions & Progression</h2>
      <p class="small">Evolutions describes how cards change for a player and across the game: upgrades (levels), visual progress (star levels, skins), and meta evolution through seasonal content and balance changes. This page breaks down the mechanical and strategic implications of progression.</p>

      <h3 id="levels">1. Card levels: what they change and why they matter</h3>
      <p>Upgrading a card increases its HP and/or damage. The numerical impact varies by rarity and card type, but the effect is often nonlinear — a small percentage increase repeated across many interactions becomes decisive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ladder environment:</strong> Card level differences are prominent. Ladder matches reward players who invest in upgrades because the raw stat increases translate to better trades and survivability.</li>
        <li><strong>Tournament-standard play:</strong> Cards are normalized to a standard level to ensure skill-focused competition. If you want to practice competitively, train at tournament standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade cost and pacing:</strong> Higher rarity cards cost more copies and gold. Plan upgrades to optimize your deck's power curve rather than upgrading randomly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="star-levels">2. Star levels and cosmetics</h3>
      <p>Star levels and skins are cosmetic evolutions that sometimes indicate player achievement. They generally do not affect mechanics, but they signal experience and can impact perceived status.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Star levels use resources like star points; they increase card visual effects but not power.</li>
        <li>Skins and emotes are monetized cosmetics — nice to have, but not required to compete.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="meta-evolution">3. Meta evolution: patches, new cards, and emergent play</h3>
      <p>The meta evolves faster than an individual player's upgrade rate because new cards and balance patches reorder matchups.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Balance patches:</strong> Small buffs or nerfs can change which counters are viable. Stay informed, read patch notes, and test impacts in friendly matches.</li>
        <li><strong>New cards:</strong> When a new card appears, the meta often undergoes a transient period of experimentation where creative counters and synergies appear. This is often the best time to find overlooked powerful combos.</li>
        <li><strong>How to adapt:</strong> Maintain a flexible core of cards; avoid overinvesting in niche tech unless it’s prevalent in your bracket.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="progression-systems">4. Season passes, challenges, and event-driven progression</h3>
      <p>Seasons and events often accelerate evolution by rewarding resources, temporary buffs, or unique cosmetic upgrades.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Season passes:</strong> Offer predictable value and exclusive cosmetic rewards. They can be cost-effective if you play regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Provide high-tier rewards for skilled play; sometimes they are tournament-standard, making them excellent practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited-time events:</strong> Temporary mechanics or card variations (e.g., Triple Elixir) create different meta mini-environments; use them to practice niche skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="upgrade-strategy">5. Smart upgrade strategies</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Focus upgrades on a small core:</strong> Upgrade the ~8–12 cards you use most often so your deck matures together; this yields compounding returns on skill.</li>
        <li><strong>Economize by rarity and utility:</strong> Level commons earlier because they require fewer copies to reach competitive levels; save rares/epics for focused investment.</li>
        <li><strong>Use clan donations:</strong> Request and donate strategically to funnel the card types your clan needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Resist vanity upgrades:</strong> Cosmetic or low-impact upgrades should be lower priority than strengthening your main decks.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="seasonal-tuning">6. Anticipating meta shifts and preparing</h3>
      <p>When a balance patch or a new season drops:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read the patch notes — identify which archetypes gain or lose power.</li>
        <li>Play a few friendly matches to test the changes before climbing the ladder.</li>
        <li>Consider building one or two flexible “meta testers” decks — decks that can plug in or swap a card to respond to trending threats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="psychology">7. Psychological effect of progression</h3>
      <p>Progression affects player psychology: stronger, upgraded cards can give confidence, but overreliance on level advantage can mask skill weaknesses. Keep practicing the fundamentals even as your cards evolve.</p>
