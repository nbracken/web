      <h2>Clans, Clan Wars, and Social Play</h2>
      <p class="small">Clans are the social hub of Clash Royale. They enable donations, practice, and competitive play. This page covers creation, management, donations, Clan Wars, and community tactics for sustained growth.</p>

      <h3 id="creating-managing">1. Creating and managing a healthy clan</h3>
      <p>Good clans have clear rules, active leadership and a culture of mentorship.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rules and culture:</strong> Publish expectations (donation minimums, activity windows, behavior). Use pinned messages for rules and role assignments.</li>
        <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Leader, co-leaders, and elders handle moderation. Rotate responsibilities to avoid burnout.</li>
        <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> Use clear tags and descriptions to attract the right players (e.g., "competitive", "social", "low-level welcome").</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="donations">2. Donations and the clan economy</h3>
      <p>Donations accelerate progression and create goodwill.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Donation etiquette:</strong> Don’t request cards you won’t use; give what members need. Reply in chat with who you donated and offer a brief tip.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizing donations:</strong> Keep donation patterns; encourage members to request cards that help the clan's active decks.</li>
        <li><strong>Donation goals:</strong> Target collective upgrades: coordinate to help specific members upgrade key cards for wars or tournaments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="wars">3. Clan Wars: strategy and logistics</h3>
      <p>Clan Wars are structured competitions requiring coordination on collection and war days.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Set scouting and practice nights. Ensure members know their preferred war decks and practice them in friendlies.</li>
        <li><strong>Collection Day:</strong> Allocate collection attempts to members who can reliably win to maximize war ticket trophies.</li>
        <li><strong>War Day:</strong> Assign players to favorable matchups. If the war has base attacks/defense, optimize base layout and choose defenders that complement the base.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Use in-game chat, Discord, or similar tools to coordinate timing and matchups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="internals">4. Internal competitions and growth</h3>
      <p>Internal tournaments and training are key to leveling up the entire clan.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly tournaments:</strong> Run 1v1 or small-team tournaments to identify strong performers and help others learn under pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Pair newer players with experienced members for personalized advice and replay reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> Celebrate contributors (donation leaders, war MVPs) to improve morale.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="war-meta">5. War-specific strategy and deck tech</h3>
      <p>War decks often need to be reliable across multiple matchups. Things to consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Use decks that can be tweaked by a single card swap for different matchups.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice under pressure:</strong> Run mock war sessions to build calm decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Counter-picking:</strong> If the war rules allow deck selection based on opponent, allocate your strongest counters accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="safety">6. Security, moderation, and community safety</h3>
      <p>Maintain clear moderation policies to keep the clan safe and welcoming.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protect member privacy; avoid sharing private account info.</li>
        <li>Enforce a code of conduct; remove members for repeated misconduct after fair warnings.</li>
      </ul>
