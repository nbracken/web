      <h2>Game Modes, Events, and Tournaments</h2>
      <p class="small">Different modes change the rules and therefore what decks and plays are optimal. This page documents the main permanent modes and common rotating events, with tips for each.</p>

      <h3 id="1v1">1v1 Ladder (Standard)</h3>
      <p>The default competitive mode. Card levels vary by player; ladder rewards consistent play and deck mastery.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Best practices: play your mains, prioritize reliable counters, and avoid risky overcommits.</li>
        <li>Meta notes: card levels and prevalent archetypes vary by trophy range; scouting replays helps tune decks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="2v2">2v2: Cooperative and chaotic</h3>
      <p>Two players per side. Emphasizes synergy, communication, and mercy draws.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Communicate quick signals (e.g., "I have Rocket") or use emotes strategically with friends.</li>
        <li>Get value by pairing long-range support with an ally's tank; beware of stealing elixir by overcommitting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="draft">Draft mode</h3>
      <p>Players take turns choosing and banning cards from a small pool. Draft emphasizes adaptability and broad card knowledge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick versatile cards with flexible roles; avoid over-specialization.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to opponent picks — infer their likely deck and choose counters.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="challenges">Challenges and special events</h3>
      <p>Weekly or seasonal events often change rules (Double Elixir, Spell Madness). These modes reward creative deckbuilding and on-the-fly adaptation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try unconventional cards in events — the meta resets and niche cards can shine.</li>
        <li>Use challenges to practice tournament-standard rules when available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="tournaments">Tournaments and competitive formats</h3>
      <p>Tournaments often use standardized card levels and best-of series. Success requires strong mental endurance and matchup knowledge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice mirror matches and build a short ban strategy if bans are part of the format.</li>
        <li>Keep a prepared sideboard of 1–2 tech swaps for known meta threats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="training">Training and practice modes</h3>
      <p>Use friendly battles, training camp, and custom matches to drill mechanics. Replays and coach feedback accelerate improvement.</p>
